# Terraform AWS VPC (Week 2)

This project demonstrates hands-on Infrastructure as Code using Terraform to provision AWS resources.

## Overview

In this project, I used Terraform to create and manage an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).  
The goal was to move beyond certifications and build real, repeatable infrastructure using industry-standard DevOps tools.

## What This Project Does

- Uses Terraform to define AWS infrastructure as code
- Provisions an AWS VPC with a custom CIDR block
- Manages infrastructure state using Terraform
- Uses AWS CLI to verify deployed resources
- Tracks all changes using Git and GitHub

## Tools & Technologies

- Terraform
- AWS (EC2 / VPC)
- AWS CLI
- Git & GitHub
- Command Line (PowerShell)
